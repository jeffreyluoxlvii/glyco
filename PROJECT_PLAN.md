### User Stories Backlog
* Create a Backlog of as many User Stories as you can come up with based on the project's scope determined by your Project Contract. Note this Backlog should be updated throughout the semester as new possible features are discussed.

### Feature Deliverables for each Sprint
* Based on the scope of the project and your design goals, prioritize general feature sets for each Sprint during the rest of the semester. Your goal for each Sprint is to have a working app to demo to the client made up of related features that provide clear value to the Client, rather than a set of "technical tasks" whose value may be hard to demonstrate in such a way that the client can appreciate. Features will likely include both a user interface component as well as backend support and be reasonably sized enough that you have confidence they can get done during a Sprint.

### Data Needs
* Because user data is regularly stolen, sold, or used inappropriately, it is becoming an important issue for both companies, customers, and law makers. Mozilla and other companies have started championing Lean Data practices to minimize what data is needed to run their apps. Justify your user data needs and practices (which will likely require a team discussion with your client).

### Team Roles for each Sprint
* Take responsibility for specific team roles during each Sprint during the rest of the semester. These roles may be fixed, but more likely will rotate among team members during the entire semester.
