### Feature Deliverables for each Sprint

**Sprint 2 - Prototype (Most Basic Features):** For this sprint, we plan to create the main interface. We will not worry about users for now, and will focus instead on creating the basic layout for the measures screen, challenges screen, and settings screen, using hard-coded data.
**Sprint 3 - Baseline Prototype (Core Functionality):** In this sprint, we will bring in Firebase, and create users and make it such that the data in the apps are pulled from and set to the database. We will also begin work on creating challenges that are computer generated.
**Sprint 4 - Alpha (Partial Full Functionality):** This sprint will focus on bringing in and integrating a selected API into our application, for example, the HealthKit, Glooco, or Dexcom APIs. We will begin working on and finishing the analytics function in the Measures page.
**Spring 5 - Beta (Full Functionality):** This sprint will involve working on exporting the data to health care officials in a concise way. 
**Sprint 6 - Production (Robust Full Functionality):** Additional front-end work, polishing up the code-base, and optimizing the code for efficiency.


### Data Needs
For our app, we will need to keep track of the users the users meal portion and when they eat/drink, their exercise levels, their blood sugar and A1C levels, and what medication to take and when to take it. Some data measurements, like blood sugar and A1C levels and exercise, can be linked to and pulled from conected apps like the Health app or Dexcom. Obviously, the most vital piece of data will be tracking blood sugar and A1C levels since that is the most important in terms of people with diabetes. The tracking and collection of the other data will provide beneficial to users in helping them live a more independent, controlled, and healthier life with less hassle than their current situations.
