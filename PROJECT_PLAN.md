### User Stories Backlog
* Create a Backlog of as many User Stories as you can come up with based on the project's scope determined by your Project Contract. Note this Backlog should be updated throughout the semester as new possible features are discussed.

### Feature Deliverables for each Sprint

**Sprint 2 - Prototype (Most Basic Features):** For this sprint, we plan to create the main interface. We will not worry about users for now, and will focus instead on creating the basic layout for the measures screen, challenges screen, and settings screen, using hard-coded data.
**Sprint 3 - Baseline Prototype (Core Functionality):** In this sprint, we will bring in Firebase, and create users and make it such that the data in the apps are pulled from and set to the database. We will also begin work on creating challenges that are computer generated.
**Sprint 4 - Alpha (Partial Full Functionality):** This sprint will focus on bringing in and integrating a selected API into our application, for example, the HealthKit, Glooco, or Dexcom APIs. We will begin working on and finishing the analytics function in the Measures page.
**Spring 5 - Beta (Full Functionality):** This sprint will involve working on exporting the data to health care officials in a concise way. 
**Sprint 6 - Production (Robust Full Functionality):** Additional front-end work, polishing up the code-base, and optimizing the code for efficiency.


### Data Needs
* Because user data is regularly stolen, sold, or used inappropriately, it is becoming an important issue for both companies, customers, and law makers. Mozilla and other companies have started championing Lean Data practices to minimize what data is needed to run their apps. Justify your user data needs and practices (which will likely require a team discussion with your client).

### Team Roles for each Sprint
* Take responsibility for specific team roles during each Sprint during the rest of the semester. These roles may be fixed, but more likely will rotate among team members during the entire semester.
