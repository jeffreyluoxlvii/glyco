### FAQs

* How do I integrate the Health app to Glyco?
* When creating an account for the first time, the app will prompt you with a window that will ask you whether or not you would like to integrate Apple's Health App with Glyco. Regardless of what is chosen, after creating an account, you can go to your phone's Settings, and then to Health, and then to Data Access & Devices, and there you can click on Glyco and choose to turn the permission on or off. 

* How do I change my measurements?
* For all of the measurements except A1C and steps, you can click on the corresponding value's tile and manually update the value. You can also click on the shortcuts that are located above the measurements, which change your measurements depending on what they are. For instance, the "EXERCISE" shortcut adds a set value of minutes to your exercise measurement. The values for these shortcuts can be changed.

* How do I change my shortcut values?
* In order to change your shortcut values, you would click on the settings button, which would be the right-most button on the bottom navigation bar. Once in the settings screen, you can click on any of the shortcuts that appear in the middle of the screen. After clicking one of the shortcuts, a popup will appear, where you can submit the value of your choice, which will be saved. 

* How do I change my account information?
* In order to change your account information, you would click on the settings button, which would be the right-most button on the bottom navigation bar. Once in the settings screen, you would click on the settings icon that is next to your name. Clicking it should take you to a new screen, which will show you your current name, email, and "Change Password". Clicking on any of the three will result in a popup appearing, which will allow you to change your name, email, or password depending on which one you clicked. After submitting a valid value, your new setting will be saved.

### Assumptions
* An assumption that we've made is that user will use the app consistently for more than one month so that the user's analytics visualization, as well as challenges, can be created most accurately.

* An assumption that we've made is that the user will not add measurements to future dates, which is why we've decided to not add functionality that would allow users to move to a date in the future.

* An assumption that we've made is that the user will integrate their phone's health kit with our app so that our app can track the user's steps and/or glucose if they use their phone's health kit as the primary way to track those measurements.

* An assumption that we've made is that the carbs consumed, as well as the calories from those carbs are of more importance to the user than overall calories.

* An assumption that we made was that creating shortcuts for meal, drink, snack, and exercise would keep the UI as minimal as possible while still takiing into account common measurements that users would want to track. 

### Expectations
* An expectation that we have is that the user will allow for integration between their phone's health kit with our app, because some of measurements depend on the measurements that are tracked in that app, such as steps.

* An expectation that we have is that the user will use the app continuously for more than a month so that we can properly visualize the user's data as well as provide the user with challenges appropriate to their measurements. This is because our challenges are created with a week's worth of data, while the data visualization visualizes a month of data.
