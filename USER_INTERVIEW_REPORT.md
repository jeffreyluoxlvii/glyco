### Summary
We conducted two potential user interviews. The first potential user's mother is 77 years old and has Type 2 diabetes, and has been living with it for more than 25 years. The mother currently lives in India, and her primary caretaker is the potential user's older sister. As a result, the mother's diet is taken care of by the caretaker, but she's unable to exercise extensively due to health issues (she had double knee replacements). Furthermore, due to the pandemic, the mother just stays at home and consumes media. She's not technologically savvy, but she does own a tablet on which she watches Youtube. She meets with her physician about every two months, but hasn't been able to recently due to the pandemic.The potential user doesn't live in India, but she does go back every two months or so. The potential user would like to use the app in order to track her mother's progress. The mother would also be a potential user, as she would actually use the app to keep track of medications and various measurements such as sugar levels, exercise, etc., for reminders to keep track of certain measurements throughout the day, and the sending of this information to her physician. Ideally, the mother would be able to use speech recognition to track her measurements, as typing can be hard for her.

The second potential user is middle-aged and has had Type 2 diabetes for more than 10 years. She works as a physical therapist in her own clinic, and due to her busy schedule, plans out many aspects of her day, such as meals and physical activity. Also due to her busy schedule, she rarely has time to exercise outside of her physical activity during work, and she's not very consistent with her monitoring. The potential user measures many things by feel, as she has had diabetes for many years. The main things that she does monitor are blood sugar (occasionally) and carbs consumed. She doesn't meet with her doctor very often (no specific number was given), but when she does, she tests her hemoglobin A1C and cholesterol beforehand. Apart from these tests, the doctor doesn't ask for anything else. The potential user would like to use the app to track common diabetes measurements such as blood sugar, exercise, food eaten, etc., without having to spend much time inputting data, and would instead like a very simple and easy UI, such as "yes or no" questions instead of questions asking for specific inputs. The potential user would like to track her measurements so that she can get aggregated data that shows her graphs and trends that demonstrate her progress. 

Something unique about the first user is that she's not very technologically savvy, so there would have to be ways to use the app that are friendlier towards people who aren't familiar with technology. Something unique about the second user is that she's extremely busy, and as a result wants the UI of the app to be extremely simple in order to save time. 

These two unique aspects of our potential users essentially ask for a way of using the app to track measurements that's extremely easy to use, both in the aspect of time as well as in the technological aspect. These two potential users want an app that anyone could use wih minimal time commitment. 

### Process
Currently, patients track their glucose levels, exercise, and diet in a variety of ways. Some patients prefer to write down all their info on paper, and hand in large stacks of paper records to the doctor during their visit. Other patients, especially those that use continuous monitoring glucose equipment by companies like Dexcom, choose to have this data taken automatically, and saved online by Dexcom, or in their Health app. Other patients choose to not record much data, and prefer to use memory as their way of recording their data. A commonality that was noticed through the interviews was that most patients knew that they should be recording data, but the hassle of recording such data was too great, and so a lot of data goes unrecorded.

### Assumptions 
* What assumptions did you have before talking to the users and how did talking to the users help to inform your app design?

### Personas
* Develop at least three personas to represent potential users of this app and justify how your personas inclusively capture the wide variety of potential user traits.

### Impacts
* Describe the contrast between users of this app's current experience with what you expect it to be after this app exists. Refer to your personas and include justifications and comments from your user interviews where possible. Note, impacts can be both positive and negative, inclusive and exclusionary, so make sure to consider many possibilities beyond the goal values the client wants to encourage with this app.
