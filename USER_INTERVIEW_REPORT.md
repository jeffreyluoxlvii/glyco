### Summary
We conducted two potential user interviews. The first potential user's mother is 77 years old and has Type 2 diabetes, and has been living with it for more than 25 years. The mother currently lives in India, and her primary caretaker is the potential user's older sister. As a result, the mother's diet is taken care of by the caretaker, but she's unable to exercise extensively due to health issues (she had double knee replacements). Furthermore, due to the pandemic, the mother just stays at home and consumes media. She's not technologically savvy, but she does own a tablet on which she watches Youtube. She meets with her physician about every two months, but hasn't been able to recently due to the pandemic.The potential user doesn't live in India, but she does go back every two months or so. The potential user would like to use the app in order to track her mother's progress. The mother would also be a potential user, as she would actually use the app to keep track of medications and various measurements such as sugar levels, exercise, etc., for reminders to keep track of certain measurements throughout the day, and the sending of this information to her physician. Ideally, the mother would be able to use speech recognition to track her measurements, as typing can be hard for her.

The second potential user is middle-aged and has had Type 2 diabetes for more than 10 years. She works as a physical therapist in her own clinic, and due to her busy schedule, plans out many aspects of her day, such as meals and physical activity. Also due to her busy schedule, she rarely has time to exercise outside of her physical activity during work, and she's not very consistent with her monitoring. The potential user measures many things by feel, as she has had diabetes for many years. The main things that she does monitor are blood sugar (occasionally) and carbs consumed. She doesn't meet with her doctor very often (no specific number was given), but when she does, she tests her hemoglobin A1C and cholesterol beforehand. Apart from these tests, the doctor doesn't ask for anything else. The potential user would like to use the app to track common diabetes measurements such as blood sugar, exercise, food eaten, etc., without having to spend much time inputting data, and would instead like a very simple and easy UI, such as "yes or no" questions instead of questions asking for specific inputs. The potential user would like to track her measurements so that she can get aggregated data that shows her graphs and trends that demonstrate her progress. 

Something unique about the first user is that she's not very technologically savvy, so there would have to be ways to use the app that are friendlier towards people who aren't familiar with technology. Something unique about the second user is that she's extremely busy, and as a result wants the UI of the app to be extremely simple in order to save time. 

These two unique aspects of our potential users essentially ask for a way of using the app to track measurements that's extremely easy to use, both in the aspect of time as well as in the technological aspect. These two potential users want an app that anyone could use wih minimal time commitment. 

### Process
Currently, patients track their glucose levels, exercise, and diet in a variety of ways. Some patients prefer to write down all their info on paper, and hand in large stacks of paper records to the doctor during their visit. Other patients, especially those that use continuous monitoring glucose equipment by companies like Dexcom, choose to have this data taken automatically, and saved online by Dexcom, or in their Health app. Other patients choose to not record much data, and prefer to use memory as their way of recording their data. A commonality that was noticed through the interviews was that most patients knew that they should be recording data, but the hassle of recording such data was too great, and so a lot of data goes unrecorded.

### Assumptions 
One of the major assumptions we had that was challenged through our user interviews was the assumption that our patients with diabetes have an inherent motivation to thoroughly track their condition. We learned from our first user interview that, as a diabetic, they want to spend the smallest amount of time possible having to manually input information about their condition. Going even farther than that, one of our other interviewees expressed that she doesn't really monitor her condition at all. She doesn't log her exercise and diet and only occasionally checks her glucose levels, simply because she's had the condition for a while and knows what works for her. This made us think a lot deeper into how we can orient this product to make it truly useful to our users (trends over time, reminders throughout the day, and an emphasis on user friendliness/simplicity).

Another major assumption that we had was that users would have a lot of fragmented data we would want to communicate. It turned out that our interviewees didn't necessarily use health tracking devices outside of their glucose monitoring device and maybe their Apple Health app. This made us think more about increasing the flexibility of our application, such as the ability to integrate at any time if needed but to also focus on in-app input tracking.

### Personas
Jessica: Jessica is a 30-year-old woman who started getting treated for diabetes several months ago. She lives a very busy life as a nurse and is often on her feet. Because of her busy lifestyle and the fact that she always has a lot on her mind, Jessica easily gets stressed with all of the sudden health apps and measurements she needs to start taking. She keeps track of her glucose levels and her steps consistently, but often forgets to input her meals and exercise. 

Alex: Alex is a 5-year-old boy who has Type I diabetes and relies on his mom for keeping track of it. He lives an active life as he goes to school from 7 AM to 3 PM. His mom keeps track of his glucose levels every day, and she tracks his meals throughout the day. She cooks all of his meals, and makes sure that he exercises regularly. Most of this tracking (diet and exercises) happens mentally, and Alex's mom relies on the trends of his glucose levels over time for doctor visits.

Scott: Scott is a 45-year-old man who has had Type II diabetes for several years now. However, since starting work remotely and staying at home due to COVID-19, he's resolved to work intentionally on his diet and exercise to improve his condition. He's started closely monitoring his calories/nutrients and exercise on MyFitnessPal, but has no way to gain insight on trends over time besides educated guesses from looking at his glucose levels. He wants to know if his change in lifestyle is truly improving his condition, but hasn't been to the doctor's office in several months due to the pandemic.

These three user personas show a variety of perspectives and needs over our user base. It covers users of the older age (Jessica and Scott), but also takes into consideration patients like Alex, whose primary caregiver will be using the application in his place. It also takes into consideration a variety of lifestlyes: Jessica lives a very busy life and finds it hard to manage consistent measurement-taking because of her schedule, Alex's school schedule means that his mother can only input his measurements at specific times of the day, and Scott has high motivation and more time to closely monitor his condition. It also considers differences in motivation - a user like Jessica and Alex's mom use the application to monitor their condition over time, but Scott has Type II diabetes and is interested in using the statistical insights of Glyco to monitor improvement.

### Impacts
Before using the app, users, like Jessica and Scott, have to constantly switch between apps in order to track their glucose levels, fitness, medication reminders, and meals. Scott is doing everything he can to live a better lifestyle and exercise but the apps he currently uses don't show him the trends and data he wants to see to compare his data to past fitness logs. The constant switching between all of the apps can seem overwhelming and feel like too much at time, causing failure to log and record certain areas of data that would be useful to both the user and doctor to see how their trends are doing and what they are eating. In Alex’s case, his mother has to purely rely on memory to track his diet and exercise since she is so busy and has to keep track of Alex’s glucose levels while also living her own life. For all users, the need to rely on different apps to keep track of their lives and consumes a lot of time out of their already busy schedule. 

After the app, the users are able to log all of their data, including glucose, exercise, diet, and reminders, conveniently within the Glyco app. Since Alex’s mom makes all of his meals, she can log his meals for the day while she also updates his glucose monitoring. Scott is able to use Glyco to track his glucose as well as his exercise, where he is able to see graphical representations of his progress over time, unlike previously using MyFitnessPal. Jessica is able to log her glucose as well as her meals and exercise all conveniently within the Glyco app. All users are able to save time throughout by having all means of tracking within the same app. They can be safe during our current global pandemic circumstances by their doctors being able to see their reports from all aspects of their life in an easy to read and understand pdf created by the Glyco app. Although they still have to take time out of their day to track, they are saving time by being able to do everything in an easy to use manner all within Glyco.
