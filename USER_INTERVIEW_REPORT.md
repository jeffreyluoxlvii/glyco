### Summary
* Summarize your interaction with your potential users, including anything relevant about the setting or existing help for them beside the app you are creating. Note something unique about each user you talked to as well as any common things that were noted by all or most users.

### Process
Currently, patients track their glucose levels, exercise, and diet in a variety of ways. Some patients prefer to write down all their info on paper, and hand in large stacks of paper records to the doctor during their visit. Other patients, especially those that use continuous monitoring glucose equipment by companies like Dexcom, choose to have this data taken automatically, and saved online by Dexcom, or in their Health app. Other patients choose to not record much data, and prefer to use memory as their way of recording their data. A commonality that was noticed through the interviews was that most patients knew that they should be recording data, but the hassle of recording such data was too great, and so a lot of data goes unrecorded.

### Assumptions 
* What assumptions did you have before talking to the users and how did talking to the users help to inform your app design?

### Personas
* Develop at least three personas to represent potential users of this app and justify how your personas inclusively capture the wide variety of potential user traits.

### Impacts
* Describe the contrast between users of this app's current experience with what you expect it to be after this app exists. Refer to your personas and include justifications and comments from your user interviews where possible. Note, impacts can be both positive and negative, inclusive and exclusionary, so make sure to consider many possibilities beyond the goal values the client wants to encourage with this app.
