### Reviews

In general, the users enjoyed the wireframe. One user stated, "I really do like the general design and UI. I think it's really clean and pretty and similar to what users expect from an app." Suggestions that were given by the users mostly centred on the displaying of data. Examples included, "The A1c units mmol/L or % should be selected in SETTINGS. Hence, only one unit should be displayed at home screen.", and "One potential change could be just a very fundamental addition of the challenges, such as a line on the graph at maybe a glucose goal of 100 mg/dl or maybe a line at 30 minutes of exercise a day, as examples, to emphasize when they met the goal and when they didn't."
