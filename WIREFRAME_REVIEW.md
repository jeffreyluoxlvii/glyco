### Reviews

In general, the users enjoyed the wireframe. One user stated, "I really do like the general design and UI. I think it's really clean and pretty and similar to what users expect from an app." Suggestions that were given by the users mostly centred on the displaying of data. Examples included, "The A1c units mmol/L or % should be selected in SETTINGS. Hence, only one unit should be displayed at home screen.", and "One potential change could be just a very fundamental addition of the challenges, such as a line on the graph at maybe a glucose goal of 100 mg/dl or maybe a line at 30 minutes of exercise a day, as examples, to emphasize when they met the goal and when they didn't."

### Positive Feedback

The general feedback was quite positive. One of the biggest notes of positive feedback we got from the users was that the interface was both visually appealing and easily navigable. The users might have had specific feedback on functionality, but they reported that they had no problems interacting with the overall wireframe and that the UI of the application is "similar to what users expect from an app."

These notes were of extreme importance to our team because one of our main focuses in the design was having a user friendly and clean design. They particularly liked the way that the Measures section was displayed, with a grid that particularly drew your eyes to the glucose and A1C levels because of the pink color. The users also gave good feedback about the Shortcuts functionality, as it increased user friendliness and increased efficiency of the input process.

### Improvements

One of the improvements that was brought up had to do mainly with settings. Instead of choosing which units to use for certain measurements, one of our users suggested that we let users choose their preferred measurements. For instance, A1C levels could be either mmol/L or %, time could be 12-hour or 24-hour, etc. 

Another improvement that was brought up by our other user was better visualization in the challenges section. What he meant by this was adding visuals to the graph shown in the challenges, such as a line on the glucose graph that represented the glucose goal, or a line on the exercise graph that represented the exercise goal.

One last improvement that both users recommended was related to privacy. Since the information stored in this app can be considered private by some users, they would want to have the option of logging out every time they close the app, or have the app lock itself when they leave it and want to go into it again, and have it be unlockable by Face ID or the phone's password.
