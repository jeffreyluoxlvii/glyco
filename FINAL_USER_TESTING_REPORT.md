### Results. 

* User 1 had an extremely smooth user flow as they navigated through the tasks. Specifically, they found it very easy to find and edit the Meal shortcut - a task they had trouble with during our last round of user testing and before we updated our Settings screen in accordance with that feedback. Overall, they reported that their UX was positive -  "It was really simple, intuitive, didn't take more than a few seconds to get acquainted with it." There were no bumps in their navigation and also no bugs that showed up, but they did have specific feedback. This feedback includes changing the yellow/red colors of the pie charts because they are misleading (e.g. sometimes the red section might actually be a good thing) and possibly permanently displaying the pop-ups of the weekly glucose chart so that it's easier to read. He said this because he thought the interactivity part was "a little weird" and might be hard to find in the beginning.

* User 2 had a similarly smooth user flow. He particularly noted that, with only his 2nd personal experience using the application, he had become quite fluent with it's interface, which is a good thing. As with User 1, he had a much easier time editing the Meal shortcut in Settings and encountered no bugs. He explicitly stated that "the improvements done to the user interface/experience are great!" Feedback obtained from this user were to change "View Analytics" to something less scientific and including a way to navigate to View Analytics through the Challenges screen also. He particularly mentioned that it's common for analytical glucose charts to show not only the average glucose level, but the distribution of readings (i.e. the "glycemic variability"). Because this isn't possible with our currently data visualization package, we discussed how this could be included in the future direction for Glyco.

### Positive feedback.

* The results were overall very promising. We got the chance to have our users, all of whom participated in our last batch of user testing, to specifically test out our changes to the Settings screen, which needed updates from our last round of feedback, and our new data visualization models on the Challenges and View Analytics screens. Another new feature we got to test was the ability to directly edit the tiles on the Measurements screen. We found that all of the users found these 3 features/additions to be intuitive and important to the functionality of Glyco. 

* Specifically we were told by User 2 that he "loves the new interface of the Settings screen" and the edits we made from feedback in the last round benefitted the UX a lot. Both of the users were also fans of the data visualization models we chose and believed the different data representations were helpful to both patients and their doctors. One of our most notable pieces feedback was: "I think it's a great app, really easy to use, like I can imagine myself spending a few min every time I do something to use it quickly and move on and maybe revisit it every night to see where I'm at, which is exactly what it should be, so that's perfect." This feedback was particularly important to us because it means we are on the right track with the purpose and functionality of what our clients wanted with Glyco, as they wished for something that was easy-to-use, efficient, and user friendly.

### What could be improved. 

* From User 1, our prioritized improvements would be to change the colors of the pie charts so that they are less ambiguous and less ambiguous (i.e. changing red and yellow to blue and pink colors). We will also attempt to see if we can permanently display the popups that are usually shown through pressing on the chart, but this may not be possible with our current data visualization package.

* From User 2, our improvements include changing "View Analytics" to something less scientific (i.e. "View Monthly Data"), and including that button somewhere on the Challenges screen. Since it's not possible for us to show glycemic variability at the moment, we will include that as future direction for the application.
