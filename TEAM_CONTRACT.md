### As a project team, we promise to:
 * Respect each other's ideas and work.
 * Communicate with the team regularly to keep everyone in the loop about the project.
 * Respect each other's time by attending all meetings or letting the group know in advance if not attending.
 * Be fully responsible for each of our own assignments, timelines, and deadlines unless the group has been notified in advance.
 * Make significant decisions only after consulting with all of the teammates, unless the team isn't able to agree on a decision, in which case it would be left to the person with the respective "role" (for example, a tech problem would be dealt with by the tech lead).
 * Participate in team decisions and tasks, as input is encouraged from and by all team members before coming to a democratic vote.

### If someone on our team breaks one or more of these promises, the team may:
 * Ignore it if it's the first time or if it was an honest mistake like forgetting about a meeting. 
 * Host interventions to talk about the situation and better practices for improvement.
 * Report the issue in the Team Sprint Report.
 * Bring up the issue with the CS408 instructors and ask for their guidance.
 * Potentially request a team member be removed from the team if intervention by the instructor doesn't work, as we believe that this would be the last straw for persistent lack of communication and/or work ethic.

### Team Procedures:
 * As a team, meet twice a week after our regularly-scheduled CS408 class time. This will happen every Monday and Wednesday after 7:05 PM EST via Zoom, and the project manager will host the Zoom meetings.
 * Preferred method of communication will be Facebook Messenger for messages and Zoom for meetings.
 * Decision-making will be by consensus, and if consensus isn't reached, the decision-making will be left to the person with the respective "role".
 * The project manager will handle setting agendas and notifying team members via Facebook Messenger. Business analyst will keep the team on track by regularly referencing the agenda and bringing our attention back if we digress.
 * The project manager will take meeting notes, as they expand off of the meeting agendas. The meeting notes will be taken during the meetings and will be immediately put into the Google Drive and disseminated to the necessary people after the meeting is over. Notes and all other documentation will be kept under the Google Drive folder (there will be a file dedicated for meeting notes).
 * Code ownership will be defined as follows: The person who wrote that code owns that code. If “necessary” (the non-owner believes modifying that code will improve the quality and responsibility of the application), they can ask for permission from the owner to modify it. They can then branch, modify the code, and document what they did and why did it under the description/merge request.

 ### Team Expectations
 * Everyone in the team desired an A.
 * Make sure to use good git practices (clear commit messages, not pushing to master, merge requests, making multiple branches, have the team together when merging branches and resolving merge errors). In the case of preparing demos, make sure the demos are rehearsed at least once before the presentation. Work should be of high quality - the kind of work that you would submit at an internship.
 * Time per week will be dependent on our deadlines as well as each member's respective schedules - can increase or decrease based on the tasks we want to complete for that week or sprint, as well as how much other work we have.
 * Regarding different work habits of individual team members, as long as everyone is on the same page about how each team member works, there should be no confusion, and thus no problem. Because of this, we would communicate what our work habits look like very early on in the semester just so everyone can get used to each other. If any situation changes, other team members should be notified immediately.
 * Regarding extra work by team members that want a better grade, it is acceptable as long as they let everyone else in the group know that they will be working on extra features. Major delegation and features will be decided on beforehand, so any changes should be brought up to the other team members and decided as a whole. If someone is slacking consistently, resulting in undesirable effects on other people’s work, then this will be reflected negatively on team evaluations. However, anything that is decided democratically is fine.
