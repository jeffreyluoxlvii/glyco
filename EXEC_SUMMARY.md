### Functionality
The main point of this application is to provide a platform for tracking diabetes, along with serving as an integration point that increases the quality and ease of communication between a patient and their physician. The application will have features including tracking insulin levels, blood sugar levels, sleep, exercise, food intake, and other measures relevant to the condition. Glyco plans to integrate data from other applications and devices commonly used by patients with diabetes, including but not limited to their smartphone's Health app, glucose monitoring device, and calorie tracking app. Second priority features include incorporation with a web application that allows the physician or close contacts to monitor and suggest weekly challenges to the patient.

### Technical Recommendation
A main talking point for this project is ease of use for people with diabetes. As we want the most amount of people to be able to use our app, a cross-platform mobile application is the clear choice of technology for this project. In terms of technology, the framework that we will be using is Flutter. Another framework that we could have chosen was React Native, but because of Flutter's great flexibility with UI components, as well as its vast amount of out-of-the-box widgets, Flutter was chosen in the end. Currently, the team is thinking of saving user data using Firebase, and so there are no expenses that currently come to mind. A kind of expense that may prop up is during testing: we may need to aquire a Dexcom transmitter.
