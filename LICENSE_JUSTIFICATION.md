## License Justification

### Open Source Licenses. 
- Flutter: BSD License
- Provider: MIT License
- Intl: BSD License
- Http: BSD License
- font_awesome_flutter: MIT License
- integration_test: BSD License
- nano_healthkit_plugin: MIT License
- shared_preferences: BSD License

### Team Preference. 
* which license does the team want to use and why

* The team wants to use the MIT License because it fits our application the best. Since our app is a mobile app that will most likely be deployed in both the Apple and Android App Stores, the MIT License would allow for commercial use, if our client does decide to use it for commercial purposes. Additionally, the MIT License allows for distribution, modification, and private use, and since the app is in its early stages, we think that it would be best to leave all of the doors open for them to decide what they ultimately want to do with their app. As such, we wouldn't want to choose a license that strips them of these options that they potentially haven't considered yet. Additionally, its only condition would be to have a copy of the license and the copyright notice, so it would allow for more permissive usage of the app if the client decides to use it in such a way.

### Client Preference. 
* which license does the client want to use (or do they not have a preference) and why

* The client doesn't have a preference in terms of which license they want to use. This is because they weren't too familiar with the available options and what their differences are, so they decided to base their decision off of our team's judgement.  

### License Choice. 
* which license did the team and client agree to use

* The team and the client agreed to use the MIT License due to the fact that the team wanted to use the MIT License, and the client had no preference. 

### License Text. 
* include the actual text of the license (this should be standard boilerplate text that you can get from the official license page or from your client -- do not attempt to write your own personal license)

* "Copyright <YEAR> <COPYRIGHT HOLDER>

### Justification. 
* explain the implications of your choice with regards to how the code will be used going forward and how that justifies the final choice

* The MIT License allows "permission... free of charge" to whoever's hands our code ends up in. As stated earlier, our code is in the early stages and we should leave it open as to what people want to do with it next moving forward. We have provided the groundwork and a great starting point but there are many things that can continue to be added or modified. It should be allowed for people to distribute or obtain a copy of the software we have created so far free of charge, which is why we chose the MIT licensing.
