## License Justification

### Open Source Licenses. 
* if your app makes includes any code you did not write (i.e., from GitHub, examples or tutorials, non-standard libraries you depend on, etc.), list them and their licenses
You may be able to use this software to help discover those dependencies.

### Team Preference. 
* which license does the team want to use and why

### Client Preference. 
* which license does the client want to use (or do they not have a preference) and why

### License Choice. 
* which license did the team and client agree to use

### License Text. 
* include the actual text of the license (this should be standard boilerplate text that you can get from the official license page or from your client -- do not attempt to write your own personal license)

### Justification. 
* explain the implications of your choice with regards to how the code will be used going forward and how that justifies the final choice
